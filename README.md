# Cisco-SIP

This script will install a PXE server that can be used to nuke Cisco
IP Phones and install some (possibly olde) SIP firmware on them.

Installation of the PXE server will include making a mess of your
/srv/tftp/ if you have one.

Best run on / tested on a fresh Linux Mint 22.x

  (or one directly into) Ethernet port

* When blinky-light sequence begins (on line buttons or reciever)...
* Release #.  Firmly dial 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 * 0 #  but DO NOT RUSH
* Phone should factory-reset and boot into firmware resinstall
* There will be a sequence of (5?) checkboxes that fill in with a
  sequence of üî≤ (todo) ‚¨áÔ∏è (downloading) ‚úÖÔ∏è (ready) ‚ñë‚ñë (flashed)
* Phone should say "Wiped for CR at TWC" when done
